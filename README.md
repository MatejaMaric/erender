Inspired by [thebennybox's 3D Software Rendering](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEETnX-uPtBUbVOok816vTl1K9vV1GgH5) series but made using C++ and [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/).
It also implements the barycentric rendering technique instead of the scanline technique. 

To compile this program you need to install `libsfml-dev` package and run `make`.
